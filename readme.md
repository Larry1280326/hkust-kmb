# Bus tracker for the kmb bus through HKUST

Based on the [api endpoints](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-td-tis_21-etakmb) on `data.gov.hk`, this webpage is for tracking the KMB buses throught HKUST.

Now, it only has the part of the route (91M) between Diamond Hill to HKUST. Will add other parts of the route and other routes later.

This is the link to the webpage: [https://larry1280326.github.io/hkust-kmb/](https://larry1280326.github.io/hkust-kmb/)
